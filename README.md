## Part1: Data Compression using traditional AE of tied weights
AE are self supervised,so we only need X value to fit the network. The input layer and output layer both have 780 units(this can be obtained from X.shape),get 4 networks for each hidden units and display their MSE
## Part2: Spatial Filer Learning
Display two functions and finding a good λ for a given ρ choice
## Part3: Visualization
Visualise the results of deep AE with pre-trainning and without pre-trainning
